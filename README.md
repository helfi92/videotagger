# videotagger
Analyzing and classifying online videos today require a very large quantity of human and computer resources, with extensive training averaging to a month. The goal of this project is to develop a much quicker web-based application that provides tagging support on top of popular videos players such as YouTube. We want to create a database where users can share their tags and have the freedom in creating and updating existing labels at any time interval of a video. At this stage, there exists a functional prototype based on an open source cross- platform multimedia player in which the user needs to download a third party library to use this application. We want to remove this dependency in order to make it available for a larger population set. The main requirement of this project is to have a web-based UI that allows users to create and support multiple tags at different time intervals of a video. To be more specific, a user will be able to filter the tags he sees depending on his/her preferences, such as seeing tags that have only been created by a specific user. By ï¿¼implementing this application, not only will the latter be available everywhere in the Internet, but it will also reduce the extensive training time.
